# SensESP 6-Relay Project

This project is based on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller and Lily GO hardware. It provides a platform for controlling 6 relays for various applications on the boat. It supports Signal K connection and supports Signal K PUT requests to toggle relays.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the ESP32-S3 microcontroller to the Lily GO T-RelayS3 hardware and ensure that the 6 relays are properly connected. You can buy T-RelayS3 at [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005561802558.html).

2. **Software Installation**: Install the necessary software dependencies by following the instructions in the [SensESP documentation](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP).

3. **Configuration**: Configure the project by modifying the necessary settings in the code. This includes setting up Wi-Fi credentials, MQTT server details, and any other project-specific configurations.

4. **Build and Flash**: Build the project and flash it onto the ESP32-S3 microcontroller using your preferred development environment.
